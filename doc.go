/*
Package cardano facilitates interaction with a Cardano node, with the
intention of allowing ledger queries and transaction signing/broadcasting.

This software is designed specifically for integration with Maya Protocol.
As such, it implements only the parts of the Cardano protocol that are
directly relevant to this integration, rather than the entire Cardano
protocol.
